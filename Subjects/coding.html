        <h2 id="intro">📌 What is Coding?</h2>
        <p>
            Coding, also known as programming, is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow. These instructions are written in specific languages that computers can understand, allowing them to perform various tasks. 
            Think of coding as giving a computer a set of detailed instructions to complete a specific job.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Aspects of Coding</h3>
        <pre>
• Programming Languages: There are many different programming languages, 
  each with its own syntax (rules) and purpose. Some popular languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Swift.

• Logic and Problem-Solving: Coding requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. 
  You need to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps that the computer can understand.

• Algorithms and Data Structures: Algorithms are sets of instructions for solving problems, 
  while data structures are ways to organize and store data. Understanding these concepts is crucial for efficient coding.

• Debugging: Finding and fixing errors in code is an essential part of the coding process. 
  It involves testing your code and identifying potential issues.
        </pre>

        <h2 id="importance">📌 Why Coding Matters</h2>
        <p>Coding has become increasingly important in today's world. Here are some reasons why:</p>
        <pre>
• Technology-Driven World: Coding is the foundation of almost every aspect of technology, 
  from websites and apps to software and artificial intelligence.

• Career Opportunities: The demand for skilled coders is high across various industries, 
  offering promising career paths.

• Creativity and Innovation: Coding allows you to build and create things, 
  from games and websites to innovative technologies that can solve problems.
        </pre>

        <p>Learning to code can be a rewarding experience, opening up opportunities for creativity, career growth, and a deeper understanding of the digital world.</p>
